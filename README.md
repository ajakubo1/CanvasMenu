# CanvasMenu
HTML menu for games and applications


## Installation

```bash

npm install canvas-menu

```

To use library in your project, you have to include canvasmenu.js in your html file
```
<script src="node_modules/canvas-menu/canvasmenu.min.js"></script>
```

## Tutorials

All of the tutorials moved to [wiki page](https://github.com/ajakubo1/CanvasMenu/wiki)

## Creating customized library bundle

By calling:

```bash
npm run deploy -- <package names>
```

You can re-create your own ``CanvasMenu`` library with chosen elements. Package names on the above example are 
reffering to the file names in src/.

So, for example, if you need a basic setup with only a menu and a button, you should call:

```bash
npm run deploy -- menu button
```

## From the author

If you have any suggestions for the library, write me an email (ajakubo1@gmail.com) or open new issue on github!

Check for updates regularly!

Please, if you'd manage to write something beautiful with it, let me know, I would really enjoy knowing that. A 
print-screen or a short movie would also be great! And - if you're willing - I can add your sample code to all of the 
samples (so that more people would know, what can you do with ``CanvasMenu``)
