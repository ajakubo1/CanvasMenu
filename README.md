## From the author

If you have any suggestions for the library, write me an email (ajakubo1@gmail.com) or open new issue on github!

Check for updates regularly!

Please, if you'd manage to write something beautiful with it, let me know, I would really enjoy knowing that. A 
print-screen or a short movie would also be great! And - if you're willing - I can add your sample code to all of the 
samples (so that more people would know, what can you do with ``CanvasMenu``)
